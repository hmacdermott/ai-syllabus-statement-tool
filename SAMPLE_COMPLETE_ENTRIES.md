## 1. Computer Science (STEM)

### Intro
AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can generate code, debug programs, and explain algorithms. In computer science, these tools are becoming standard in professional practice, but they can also prevent you from developing the problem-solving skills and debugging instincts that define computational thinking. This policy helps you learn when AI enhances your work versus when it short-circuits essential learning.

### Context
In computer science, the ability to think algorithmically, design systems, and debug independently are foundational skills that require sustained practice and struggle.

### Policy Rationales

**noAI**: AI cannot develop your ability to break problems into logical steps, design algorithms from first principles, or debug code by tracing execution. These cognitive skills emerge through practice, failure, and revision—experiences AI tools would bypass.

**limited**: You may use AI for syntax checking, exploring alternative approaches, or understanding error messages, but algorithm design and core problem-solving logic must be your own. AI can help you work more efficiently once you understand what you're trying to accomplish.

**ok**: You remain responsible for understanding every line of code you submit, testing edge cases thoroughly, and ensuring your solution actually solves the problem. AI-generated code is a starting point, not a finished product.

**required**: Learning to prompt AI coding tools effectively, evaluate their suggestions critically, and integrate AI-generated code into larger systems is becoming essential for modern software development. Understanding AI's limitations in code generation prepares you for professional practice.

## 2. English (Humanities)

### Intro
AI can generate literary analysis, suggest interpretations, and produce polished prose about texts you've read. However, the capacity for close reading—noticing diction, syntax, imagery, and form—and developing your analytical voice through writing requires sustained practice that AI would bypass. This policy protects the reading and writing practice that develops literary thinking.

### Context
In English, close reading skill, analytical voice, and the ability to construct nuanced arguments about texts develop through repeated practice with reading and writing.

### Policy Rationales

**noAI**: AI cannot develop your ability to notice how language works at the sentence level, construct original arguments grounded in textual evidence, or articulate ideas in your authentic voice. These capacities emerge from sustained reading and writing practice.

**limited**: You may use AI for brainstorming essay structures or researching literary criticism after forming your own interpretation, but close reading, argument construction, and your writing voice must be authentically yours. AI can suggest improvements but shouldn't generate your analysis.

**ok**: You remain responsible for ensuring all claims are grounded in textual evidence, arguments are original and nuanced, and your writing reflects your developing analytical voice. AI can help with editing, but the thinking and writing must be yours.

**required**: Understanding how AI generates literary analysis—and why its interpretations tend toward generic patterns—helps you think critically about both literature and language models, developing skills relevant as AI increasingly mediates textual interpretation.

## 3. Biology (Natural Sciences)

### Intro
AI tools can identify species from images, analyze genetic sequences, and generate hypotheses about biological mechanisms. While AI is revolutionizing biological research—from protein folding prediction to ecological monitoring—the ability to observe organisms carefully, design experiments, and reason from first principles about biological systems remains irreplaceable in biological practice.

### Context
In biology, developing observational skills, understanding evolutionary and mechanistic reasoning, and learning to design controlled experiments are fundamental to thinking like a biologist.

### Policy Rationales

**noAI**: AI cannot develop your ability to observe organisms in detail, recognize anatomical patterns, design experiments that control for confounding variables, or reason about biological mechanisms using evolutionary and physiological principles. These skills require direct engagement with living systems.

**limited**: You may use AI for literature searches or data visualization after collecting and analyzing your own data, but experimental design, organism identification through careful observation, and biological interpretation must reflect your developing understanding of biological principles.

**ok**: You remain responsible for ensuring your observations are accurate, your experimental designs control for relevant variables, and your interpretations reflect sound biological reasoning about mechanisms, evolution, and ecology. AI can assist analysis but cannot replace biological judgment.

**required**: Learning to use AI tools for sequence analysis, structure prediction, or image classification prepares you for modern biological research where computational approaches are increasingly central—but only if you understand the biological principles underlying these tools.

## 4. Economics (Social Sciences)

### Intro
AI can analyze economic data, run econometric models, and generate economic analysis—but economic thinking requires understanding theoretical frameworks, evaluating assumptions, and reasoning about policy implications. This policy helps you develop the analytical skills and theoretical understanding essential to economics.

### Context
In economics, understanding economic models, reasoning about assumptions and mechanisms, and evaluating empirical evidence require practice with both theoretical and applied analysis.

### Policy Rationales

**noAI**: AI cannot develop your ability to think through economic mechanisms, evaluate whether model assumptions fit real-world situations, or reason about policy trade-offs. These capacities require working through problems and understanding economic logic deeply.

**limited**: You may use AI for calculations or data analysis after setting up models and identifying appropriate methods yourself, but economic reasoning, model specification, and policy analysis must demonstrate your understanding of economic principles.

**ok**: You remain responsible for economic logic, appropriateness of methods, correct interpretation of results, and realistic assessment of policy implications. AI can perform analysis, but economic reasoning is yours.

**required**: Learning to work with economic data analytics, machine learning for prediction, and computational methods prepares you for modern economics where these tools are increasingly standard—but only when grounded in economic theory and judgment.

## 5. Music (Creative Arts)

### Intro
AI can compose music, generate arrangements, and analyze musical structures—but musical understanding requires developing aural skills, instrumental or vocal technique, and the ability to make expressive musical decisions. This policy protects the practice and deep listening essential to musicianship.

### Context
In music, ear training, performance technique, and understanding of musical structure through listening and analysis require sustained practice with sound and repeated performance experience.

### Policy Rationales

**noAI**: AI cannot develop your ability to hear harmonic progressions, perform with technical control and musical expression, or analyze how music creates meaning through sound. These capacities require extensive practice with listening, performing, and musical analysis.

**limited**: You may use music software for notation or playback after composing or arranging yourself, but musical ideas, performance technique, and analytical understanding must develop through your work with sound and sustained musical practice.

**ok**: You remain responsible for musical decisions, performance technique, and analytical interpretations grounded in careful listening. AI can assist with notation or information, but musical understanding requires your ears and interpretive judgment.

**required**: Understanding how AI generates music—and its limitations in creating genuinely expressive or innovative musical works—helps you think critically about creativity, expression, and technology's role in musical practice.

## 6. Arabic (Languages)

### Intro
AI translation tools can work with Arabic text—but learning Arabic requires mastering the Arabic script, understanding root-pattern morphology, and developing reading fluency in a language with grammatical and writing systems fundamentally different from English. This policy protects language acquisition essential to Arabic proficiency.

### Context
In Arabic language learning, mastering the Arabic alphabet and script, understanding trilateral root systems, and reading without vowel markings require sustained practice with fundamentally different linguistic structures.

### Policy Rationales

**noAI**: AI cannot develop your ability to recognize Arabic script, understand root-pattern word formation, or read unvocalized texts with comprehension. These skills require extensive practice with Arabic writing and grammatical systems.

**limited**: You may use AI for vocabulary assistance or root identification after attempting work yourself, but script practice, grammar exercises, and translation must demonstrate your developing Arabic language skills and understanding of morphological patterns.

**ok**: You remain responsible for script accuracy, grammatical correctness, understanding of root-pattern relationships, and reading comprehension. AI can assist your learning process but cannot replace the practice required for Arabic proficiency.

**required**: Understanding how AI processes Arabic—and its challenges with unvocalized text, dialectal variation, and cultural context—prepares you for professional work requiring both Arabic skills and awareness of language technology's capabilities and limitations.

## 8. Women's, Gender & Sexuality Studies (Interdisciplinary)

### Intro
AI can provide information about gender and sexuality—but WGSS requires critical analysis of power, intersectionality, and how knowledge itself is gendered and sexualized. This policy helps you develop the critical frameworks and analytical skills essential to gender and sexuality studies.

### Context
In WGSS, analyzing power relations, understanding intersectionality, and engaging critically with how gender and sexuality shape and are shaped by knowledge production require sustained engagement with feminist and queer theory.

### Policy Rationales

**noAI**: AI cannot develop your ability to analyze intersecting systems of power, understand lived experiences of gender and sexuality in context, or engage critically with how knowledge production has been shaped by patriarchy and heteronormativity.

**limited**: You may use AI for background research after developing your own analysis, but feminist and queer analysis, attention to intersectionality, and critical engagement with power must demonstrate your understanding of WGSS frameworks.

**ok**: You remain responsible for intersectional analysis, accurate and respectful representation of diverse experiences of gender and sexuality, engagement with feminist and queer theory, and critical awareness of how power shapes knowledge.

**required**: Understanding how AI encodes gender and sexuality—including biases and assumptions in training data and algorithms—is essential for feminist and queer critique of technology and for thinking about how AI systems reproduce or challenge gender and sexual norms.
