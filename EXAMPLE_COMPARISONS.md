# Department-Specific Language Examples

This document shows how the AI syllabus language is uniquely tailored to different departments' methods and priorities.

---

## Example 1: How "noAI" rationale differs across fields

### Computer Science
> "AI cannot develop your ability to break problems into logical steps, design algorithms from first principles, or debug code by tracing execution. These cognitive skills emerge through practice, failure, and revision—experiences AI tools would bypass."

**Focus**: Algorithmic thinking, debugging instincts, learning from failure

---

### English
> "AI cannot develop your ability to notice how language works at the sentence level, construct original arguments grounded in textual evidence, or articulate ideas in your authentic voice. These capacities emerge from sustained reading and writing practice."

**Focus**: Close reading, analytical voice, textual evidence

---

### Biology
> "AI cannot develop your ability to observe organisms in detail, recognize anatomical patterns, design experiments that control for confounding variables, or reason about biological mechanisms using evolutionary and physiological principles. These skills require direct engagement with living systems."

**Focus**: Observation, experimental design, mechanistic reasoning

---

### Philosophy
> "AI cannot develop your ability to identify logical fallacies, construct valid arguments, or reason through conceptual problems systematically. Philosophical thinking emerges from wrestling with difficult questions and testing your reasoning against counterarguments."

**Focus**: Logical reasoning, conceptual problem-solving, argumentation

---

### Music
> "AI cannot develop your ability to hear harmonic progressions, perform with technical control and musical expression, or analyze how music creates meaning through sound. These capacities require extensive practice with listening, performing, and musical analysis."

**Focus**: Aural skills, performance technique, embodied practice

---

### Economics
> "AI cannot develop your ability to think through economic mechanisms, evaluate whether model assumptions fit real-world situations, or reason about policy trade-offs. These capacities require working through problems and understanding economic logic deeply."

**Focus**: Economic reasoning, model assumptions, policy analysis

---

## Example 2: How "limited" rationale differs by discipline

### Data Science
> "You may use AI for data preprocessing or exploring alternative approaches after you've analyzed the problem structure, but model selection, interpretation, and validation must demonstrate your statistical reasoning. AI can suggest methods, but you must justify why they're appropriate."

**Allowed**: Preprocessing, exploring options (after analysis)
**Required from student**: Model selection justification, interpretation

---

### History
> "You may use AI for locating sources or understanding historical background after engaging with primary sources yourself, but source analysis, contextualization, and historical argument construction must reflect your reasoning about evidence and context."

**Allowed**: Finding sources, background info (after primary source work)
**Required from student**: Source evaluation, contextual reasoning

---

### Chemistry & Biochemistry
> "You may use computational tools for molecular modeling or data analysis after conducting experiments and proposing mechanisms, but experimental design, mechanism prediction, and interpretation of your results must demonstrate your chemical reasoning."

**Allowed**: Computational tools (after experiments complete)
**Required from student**: Mechanism prediction, chemical reasoning

---

### Journalism & Mass Communications
> "You may use AI for research or drafting assistance after developing news angles and communication strategies yourself, but reporting, editorial judgment, and ethical reasoning must demonstrate your developing professional skills."

**Allowed**: Research, draft assistance (after strategy developed)
**Required from student**: News judgment, ethical reasoning

---

## Example 3: How "required" rationale reflects professional context

### Computer Science
> "Learning to prompt AI coding tools effectively, evaluate their suggestions critically, and integrate AI-generated code into larger systems is becoming essential for modern software development. Understanding AI's limitations in code generation prepares you for professional practice."

**Professional reality**: AI coding assistants are industry standard

---

### Classics
> "Learning to use digital corpora, text databases, and computational text analysis prepares you for modern classical scholarship while maintaining the language skills and cultural knowledge that distinguish classical studies."

**Professional reality**: Digital humanities tools are increasingly used in classical scholarship

---

### Art & Art History
> "Understanding AI as both creative tool and subject of critical analysis is increasingly relevant to contemporary art practice and theory, preparing you to engage with technology's role in image-making and visual culture."

**Professional reality**: AI is both tool and subject of contemporary art

---

### Sociology & Anthropology
> "Understanding how AI analyzes social data—and its limitations in handling meaning, context, and power relations—prepares you for social research increasingly using computational methods while maintaining the interpretive skills essential to sociology and anthropology."

**Professional reality**: Computational social science is growing, but interpretive skills remain essential

---

## Example 4: Language-specific customization

### Arabic
> **noAI**: "AI cannot develop your ability to recognize Arabic script, understand root-pattern word formation, or read unvocalized texts with comprehension. These skills require extensive practice with Arabic writing and grammatical systems."

**Unique challenge**: Script, root-pattern morphology, unvocalized text

---

### German
> **noAI**: "AI cannot develop your understanding of case endings, your ability to parse complex German sentence structure, or your capacity to produce idiomatic German. These skills emerge from grammatical practice and extensive reading and writing in German."

**Unique challenge**: Case system, complex syntax

---

### East Asian Languages & Literatures
> **noAI**: "AI cannot develop your character recognition, understanding of grammar patterns, or ability to read literary Chinese, Japanese, or Korean texts with cultural and linguistic nuance. These skills require extensive practice with writing systems and grammatical structures."

**Unique challenge**: Character systems, fundamentally different grammar

---

## Example 5: Critical frameworks in interdisciplinary programs

### Africana Studies
> **required**: "Understanding how AI processes information about race, Africa, and diaspora cultures—including biases in training data—is essential for thinking critically about technology's role in representing and potentially distorting these histories and cultures."

**Critical lens**: AI biases about race and representation

---

### Women's, Gender & Sexuality Studies
> **required**: "Understanding how AI encodes gender and sexuality—including biases and assumptions in training data and algorithms—is essential for feminist and queer critique of technology and for thinking about how AI systems reproduce or challenge gender and sexual norms."

**Critical lens**: Gender and sexuality encoded in algorithms

---

### Poverty Studies
> **required**: "Understanding how AI systems may perpetuate or exacerbate inequality—through algorithmic bias, automated decision systems affecting poor communities, and data-driven policies—is essential for critical poverty studies in the age of algorithmic governance."

**Critical lens**: Algorithmic systems and inequality

---

### Middle East & South Asia Studies
> **required**: "Understanding how AI processes information about the Middle East and South Asia—and biases in how these regions are represented in training data—is essential for critical engagement with technology's role in representing regions often subject to Orientalist distortion."

**Critical lens**: Orientalism in AI training data

---

## Example 6: Professional judgment vs. technical skills

### Accounting & Finance
> **ok**: "You remain responsible for correctness of financial analysis, appropriateness of accounting treatments, ethical soundness of recommendations, and professional judgment about financial reporting. AI can perform calculations, but professional judgment is yours."

**Distinction**: AI does calculations; student exercises professional judgment

---

### Business Administration
> **ok**: "You remain responsible for strategic soundness, realistic assessment of implementation challenges, understanding of organizational dynamics, and recognition that business problems rarely have single correct answers. AI can provide information, but judgment is yours."

**Distinction**: AI provides information; student exercises strategic judgment

---

### Physics & Engineering
> **ok**: "You remain responsible for checking whether AI-generated solutions satisfy conservation laws, dimensional analysis, and limiting case behaviors. Engineering judgment—knowing when to trust calculations and when something is wrong—is yours to develop and maintain."

**Distinction**: AI performs calculations; student validates with physical intuition

---

## Example 7: Field-specific observational skills

### Earth & Environmental Geoscience
> **noAI**: "AI cannot develop your ability to read stratigraphic sequences, interpret satellite imagery in geological context, or observe environmental processes in the field. These skills require learning to see what's actually present in rocks, landscapes, and environmental data—not what AI suggests should be there."

**Observational skill**: Reading rocks and landscapes in the field

---

### Biology
> **noAI**: "AI cannot develop your ability to observe organisms in detail, recognize anatomical patterns, design experiments that control for confounding variables, or reason about biological mechanisms using evolutionary and physiological principles."

**Observational skill**: Detailed organism observation and pattern recognition

---

### Art & Art History
> **noAI**: "AI cannot develop your drawing skills, color sense, compositional judgment, or ability to analyze how artworks function visually. In studio work, AI would bypass the technical skills and creative problem-solving built through practice. In art history, AI cannot replace close looking and interpretive skill."

**Observational skill**: Visual analysis and "close looking" at art

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **No generic language**: Each department has distinctive disciplinary vocabulary and concerns

2. **Methods-based**: Language reflects actual research practices (fieldwork, close reading, lab work, performance)

3. **Skills-focused**: Emphasizes what practice develops (algorithmic thinking, physical intuition, aural skills)

4. **Professionally grounded**: Acknowledges how AI is actually used in each field's professional practice

5. **Pedagogically sound**: Explains why constraints exist (to develop skills) rather than just imposing rules

6. **Respectful of disciplines**: Shows understanding of what makes each field distinctive and valuable

---

**Result**: Faculty see themselves and their discipline in the language, making them more likely to adopt and adapt these policies for their courses.
