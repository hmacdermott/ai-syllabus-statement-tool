                        why: "Debugging teaches problem-solving patterns and algorithmic thinking. AI can generate working code, but that doesn't build the diagnostic skills needed to troubleshoot when code fails. The skill comes from wrestling with errors yourself."

                        question: "Can students verify AI solutions and explain why?",
                        why: "Understanding why code works is more important than having code that works. If students can't explain the logic, they haven't learned computer science—they've just successfully prompted an AI. Verification requires deep comprehension."

                        why: "Algorithmic thinking—breaking problems into logical steps—is the core transferable skill in CS. AI can execute algorithms, but using AI-generated solutions doesn't develop your capacity to design algorithms from first principles."

                        question: "Are students developing problem decomposition skills independently?",
                        why: "Breaking complex problems into manageable subproblems is essential for programming. AI can decompose problems for you, but that cognitive work is where learning happens. Without practice decomposing problems, students can't tackle novel challenges."

                        why: "Tracing how code executes line-by-line builds mental models of program behavior. This skill is essential for debugging and optimization. AI can explain execution, but reading an explanation doesn't build the same mental model as tracing it yourself."

Learning to write clear code with good variable names, logical organization, and helpful comments is a professional skill AI doesn't teach."

Students should write initial documentation themselves, but AI can help with formatting or expanding brief comments after the core explanation is their own."

If AI fills gaps for students (providing missing steps, explaining connections), those gaps remain hidden until students face problems AI can't solve. The gaps must be addressed, not papered over."

AI provides procedural shortcuts (just do these steps), which can prevent students from understanding the mathematical principles underlying the procedures. Understanding 'why' requires working through problems conceptually."
